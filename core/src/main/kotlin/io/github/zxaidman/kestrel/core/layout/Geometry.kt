/**
 * Where a control sits, in terms that survive being moved to another phone.
 *
 * `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md` requires coordinates that are device-independent rather than one
 * phone's pixels. That is the easy half. The hard half is that "normalised" alone is not enough:
 * a layout built on a 20:9 phone and opened on a 4:3 tablet has to remain *playable*, and the two
 * ways of naively normalising both fail.
 *
 * - Normalising position against the full width and height moves a thumb-reachable control into the
 *   middle of a wider screen.
 * - Normalising *size* against width and height independently turns a round button into an ellipse.
 *
 * So position and size are normalised differently, and deliberately:
 *
 * - **Position** is an offset from an [Anchor], so a control pinned to the bottom-left corner stays
 *   in the corner where a thumb is, whatever the screen becomes.
 * - **Size** is measured against the surface's **shorter side only**, so a control keeps its shape
 *   and its physical size relative to the hand holding the phone.

 * is written in.
