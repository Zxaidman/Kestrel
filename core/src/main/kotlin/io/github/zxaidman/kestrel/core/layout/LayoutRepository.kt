/**
 * Where a layout comes from, whoever wrote it.
 *
 * Two sources with one interface, because the difference between them is ownership rather than
 * format: a built-in is a file Kestrel ships and a user layout is a file in the user's folder, and
 * both are read by the same reader and validated by the same rules. A caller asks for an id and
 * gets a layout or a typed reason.
 *
 * **Built-ins are immutable, and this is where that is enforced** rather than by a disabled button
 * somewhere in the interface. [save] refuses a built-in id outright; [duplicate] is the only way to
 * get an editable copy of one. That makes the workflow `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md` describes —
 * Built-in → Duplicate → User copy → Edit — the only path there is, instead of the path people are
 * asked to follow.
