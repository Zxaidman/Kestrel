/**
 * Turns a layout back into a document.
 *
 * The property that matters is that **what was read comes back out**: a layout imported, opened in
 * the editor and exported again must still be the same layout, including the fields this build has
 * never heard of. Unknown fields are written back exactly where they were found, which is the
 * forward-compatibility promise `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md` makes being kept rather than
 * described.
 *
 * Optional fields are written only when they carry something. A file full of `"label": null` and
 * `"rotation": 0` is harder to read and harder to hand-edit, and hand-editing is a thing this
 * project's own owner does.

     * expresses one point from a different origin, so the stored value is measured, re-derived and
     * stored again. At two decimals — 10.8 px on the reference device — the control jumped
     * (`BUG-48`, `BUG-51`); at three it stopped jumping and started *walking*, one thousandth per
     * cycle (`BUG-52`). Four is 0.11 px, where a full cycle cannot reach one storable step.
     *
     * This writer was rounding to two, which is why three decimals never reached a file at all —
     * the editor held them and the writer threw them away on the way out.
     *
     * Padded to four because the project owner hand-edits these files, and a column where one line
     * reads `0.1` and the next `0.2637` cannot be scanned by eye (`FEAT-60`). `0.1` is written
     * `0.1000`.
     *
     * Rotation is left out of both: it is an angle in degrees, on a different scale from the four
     * fractions, and `0.0000` degrees is noise rather than alignment.
