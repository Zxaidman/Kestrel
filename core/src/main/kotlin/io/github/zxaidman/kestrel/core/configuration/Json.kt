/**
 * Turns JSON text into a [ConfigNode], and refuses anything that is not JSON.
 *
 * **Why this is here rather than a dependency.** `core` is plain Kotlin on purpose — it is where the
 * rules live, and it must be testable without a device or an emulator. Every configuration rule in
 * this module operates on `ConfigNode`, so without something that produces one from text, the only
 * place a document could be read is `platform/`, and the only place it could be *tested* is on a
 * phone. That would put the validation this project depends on behind the slowest feedback loop it
 * has. A reader small enough to hold in one file buys the fast loop back, and costs no dependency.
 *
 * **Strict on purpose.** An imported document is untrusted input (`SECURITY.md`), so this accepts
 * JSON and not the various things that look like it: no comments, no trailing commas, no unquoted
 * keys, no single quotes, no trailing content after the value. Being permissive here would mean
 * accepting a file, writing it back out differently, and leaving the user to work out which of the
 * two is what they meant.
 *
 * Numbers are all [Double], matching `ConfigNode.Num`. JSON has one number type and so does this;
 * whether a value is an integer is a question for the field that reads it, and `ConfigReader`
 * already asks it.
