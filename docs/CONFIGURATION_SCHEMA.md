# Kestrel — Configuration Schema

**Document:** `docs/CONFIGURATION_SCHEMA.md`  
**Status:** Active — schema version 1, no implementation yet  

## Purpose

Kestrel is JSON-first. Configuration should be portable, inspectable, versioned, exportable, migration-friendly, safe to import, and independent of UI code or a specific input backend.

## Configuration types

Initial conceptual types:

- controller-definition
- controller-layout
- controller-skin
- gaming-profile
- application-record
- aspect-ratio-preset
- community-manifest
- compatibility-record

## Common fields

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "controller-layout",
  "id": "example.id",
  "name": "Example"
}
```

Optional metadata may include version, author, description, license, tags, source, sourceTemplate, createdAt and updatedAt.

## Schema versioning

Every schema has an explicit version.

- incompatible changes require a new schema version
- migrations should be explicit
- unsupported future versions fail safely
- old configurations must not be silently reinterpreted

## Stable IDs

IDs are distinct from display names. Examples:

```text
builtin.xbox.default
builtin.ps.default
user.<uuid>
profile.<uuid>
skin.<uuid>
```

Renaming must not require changing a stable ID.

## Controller definition

Defines logical controls, not screen positions.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "controller-definition",
  "id": "controller.xbox",
  "name": "Xbox-style Controller",
  "buttons": ["A", "B", "X", "Y", "LB", "RB", "START", "BACK"],
  "axes": ["LEFT_X", "LEFT_Y", "RIGHT_X", "RIGHT_Y"],
  "triggers": ["LT", "RT"]
}
```

## Controller layout

Defines arrangement and mapping.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "controller-layout",
  "id": "builtin.xbox.default",
  "name": "Xbox Default",
  "builtin": true,
  "editable": false,
  "controllerDefinition": "controller.xbox",
  "elements": []
}
```

## Built-in layouts

Built-ins are immutable. Repository/domain code must reject attempts to overwrite them.

```text
Built-in → Duplicate → User layout → Edit
```

## Layout elements

May define:

- id
- control
- group
- shape
- x/y
- width/height
- rotation
- visibility
- opacity
- mapping
- behavior
- anchors

### `control` and capability

`control` names what the element **is** — `button`, `dpad`, `stick`, `analog-trigger`,
`digital-trigger`, `decoration`. What a backend must provide for it to work is **derived from that
kind**, never stored in the document.

That is deliberate. Storing the requirement would freeze today's understanding of capability into
every file ever exported, and a document written now would mean the wrong thing after the capability
model gains a distinction. Storing the kind means a layout keeps meaning what its author meant.

`ADR-007` decides what happens when the active backend cannot provide it: the element is **shown and
disabled**, never removed, never substituted. `digital-trigger` exists as a separate kind for the
same reason — a user may choose a digital trigger, and it then works where an analog one cannot, but
the product never performs that substitution on their behalf.

Coordinates should use a device-independent or normalized representation rather than one phone's raw pixels as the canonical source.

### `group` — which controls share a window

Optional. Elements naming the same group are drawn in **one window**; an element with no group gets
one to itself.

It is not decoration, and it is not a category. **It decides whether a thumb can slide from one
control to another**, because a finger belongs to the window that received its touch-down for the
life of the gesture. Rolling across face buttons and pressing each in turn works only if they share
a window; so does holding a stick press and then moving the stick.

It is **declared rather than inferred**, and that was learned the hard way. Deriving it from how
close two controls were drawn failed on the shipped layout: the gap that had to mean *together* and
the gap that had to mean *apart* were fifteen pixels apart, so the answer flipped with rounding and
with the size setting. A gesture that works at one size and not another is worse than one that never
worked.

The cost is real and bounds how groups should be used: a window is dead to whatever is underneath
everywhere its controls are not, so a group should be controls a thumb would genuinely travel
between rather than everything on one side of the screen.

### `shape` — what a control is drawn and pressed as

Optional, one of `circle` (the default), `square`, `rectangle`.

Separate from the kind, and the separation matters: a kind says what a control **does**, a shape
says what it **looks like**. A shoulder button is a rectangle on most pads and a circle on some, and
nothing about which one it is changes what it sends.

- `circle` — drawn and pressed as a circle of `min(width, height) / 2`.
- `square` — a rounded square of the shorter side. Stated rather than left to equal width and height,
  so a control stays square when a hand-edited file makes them slightly uneven.
- `rectangle` — a rounded rectangle using `width` and `height` as given.

**The shape decides where the control can be pressed, not only how it is drawn.** A rectangle
hit-tested as a circle would have corners that look pressable and are not, which is a fault a player
feels and cannot describe.

A stick and a d-pad are drawn round whatever the shape says. Deflection is a distance from a centre,
and a rectangular stick would reach further along its diagonal than along its sides.

### How position and size are normalised, and why differently

Normalising alone is not enough: a layout built on a 20:9 phone and opened on a squarer screen has
to stay *playable*, and both naive approaches fail. Normalising position against full width and
height moves a thumb-reachable control towards the middle of a wider screen. Normalising size
against width and height independently turns a round button into an ellipse.

So the two are normalised differently, on purpose:

- **Position** is an offset from an **anchor** — one of nine points on the surface. A control pinned
  to the bottom-left corner stays where a thumb rests, whatever the screen becomes. Offsets are
  applied *inwards* from the anchor, so an author never writes a negative number to move a
  right-hand control away from the right edge.
- **Size** is measured against the surface's **shorter side only**, so a control keeps its shape and
  its size relative to the hand holding the phone — and rotating the phone does not resize anything.

Both are in the same unit, so a control and its offsets scale together and an arrangement holds its
proportions.

### Precision

Placement numbers are written to **three decimal places, padded** — `0.1` is written `0.100`.

**Padded**, because these files are hand-edited and a column where one line reads `0.1` and the next
`0.2637` cannot be scanned by eye.

**And rounded here and nowhere else**, which took three attempts to get right and is the more
important half. Changing a control's anchor re-derives its offsets from its own previous offsets: the
position is measured, expressed against a different origin, and stored again. Rounding at that step
feeds the error back in, so the value walks by half a step per change — at two decimals (10.8 px on a
1080-pixel short side), at three (1.1 px) and at four (0.11 px) alike. Adding decimals shrank the step
and never changed the shape.

**The rule that came out of it:** an operation whose only input is its own previous output must not
round. Round when the value leaves the program. With the walk gone, three decimals is simply what a
hand-edited file wants.

A reader must accept any number of decimals; this is how Kestrel *writes*, not what it requires.
Rotation is exempt — it is an angle in degrees, on a different scale from the three fractions.

Settings are padded to **two** decimals rather than three. They are slider values, and a slider offers
two — writing `1.200` would claim a precision the control cannot produce.

### Insets

The usable surface excludes display cutouts and gesture areas. Those are device-specific, which is
exactly why a layout must not encode them: the surface subtracts them, and the same layout lands
correctly on a phone with a cutout and one without.

A control that falls outside the usable area is **reported, not corrected**. Running a control off
an edge can be a deliberate design, and the same principle as `ADR-007` applies — the product says
what it sees rather than overruling the author.

### Rotation

Rotation is part of hit testing, not only of drawing. A touch is tested by rotating the *point* back
around the control's centre and comparing against an upright rectangle, which is exact. A rotated
control's bounding box is larger than its own width and height, and the bounding box is used only as
an editor hint about overlap — never to decide which control receives a touch.

## Skin

A skin defines appearance only.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "controller-skin",
  "id": "builtin.minimal.dark",
  "name": "Minimal Dark",
  "assets": {},
  "styles": {}
}
```

A layout must not depend on one skin.

## Gaming profile

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "gaming-profile",
  "id": "profile.1234",
  "name": "Moonlight Xbox",
  "application": {"packageName": "example.package"},
  "layout": "builtin.xbox.default",
  "skin": "builtin.minimal.dark",
  "display": {
    "orientation": "LANDSCAPE",
    "scalingMode": "FIT",
    "aspectRatio": "16:9"
  },
  "input": {}
}
```

## Manual application record

```json
{
  "packageName": "com.example.game",
  "source": "USER",
  "preferredProfile": "profile.1234"
}
```

## Aspect ratios

Aspect ratios are data:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "type": "aspect-ratio-preset",
  "id": "16:9",
  "width": 16,
  "height": 9,
  "builtin": true
}
```

Initial presets include 4:3, 16:9, 18:9, 19.5:9, 20:9 and 21:9.

## Community manifests

Community repositories should expose declarative metadata such as:

```text
id, type, name, author, version, license,
download, checksum, minimumKestrelVersion,
compatibility, preview
```

Community content must not be executable.

## Validation

Every import must validate:

- schema version
- required fields
- field types
- ID format
- numeric ranges
- enum values
- collection sizes
- references
- file limits

Invalid data must produce a typed error and must not crash the application.

The typed errors are `ConfigurationError` in `core/configuration/`, and each names the field it
concerns. A user handed someone else's layout and told only that it is invalid has no way forward;
told that `elements[3].opacity` is 1.4 and must be between 0 and 1, they can fix it or report it
usefully.

Two ordering rules, because they change what the other checks mean:

- **Schema version is checked first.** A document from a future version is not malformed — this
  build is simply older — and it must be reported as such rather than as an invalid file.
- **Document type is checked before any type-specific field.** Reading a skin as a layout should
  say so, not fail later on a missing field that was never going to be there.

## Unknown fields

Unknown non-executable fields should ideally be preserved where safe to improve forward compatibility.

Implemented: validation reads from the parsed document rather than consuming it, and every header
carries the fields it did not recognise. A document written by a newer build at the same schema
version keeps those fields when this build re-exports it, instead of quietly losing them.

## Export/import

Users must be able to export and re-import their own layouts, skins, profiles, and applicable configuration.

## Security boundary

Configuration is data. Do not introduce fields that execute shell commands, arbitrary code, native libraries, or downloaded plugins without a separate security design.
