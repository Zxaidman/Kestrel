/**
 * The part of this phone's screen a pad can actually be put on.
 *
 * There is one answer to this question and two places that need it: the overlay, which is placed
 * into that area by the window manager, and the editor, which has to *draw* it. They must agree —
 * an editor whose canvas is the shape of its own window rather than the shape of the phone shows
 * controls overlapping that do not overlap on the device, and clear ones that do. That is worse
 * than editing numbers in a file, because it invites trust it has not earned.
 *
 * Insets are subtracted with `getInsetsIgnoringVisibility`, not the visible ones: a status bar that
 * is hidden right now can come back while a pad is on screen, and a layout arranged against the
 * whole display then shifts and overlaps itself the moment it does. That failure was reported and
 * this is the fix that holds it.
