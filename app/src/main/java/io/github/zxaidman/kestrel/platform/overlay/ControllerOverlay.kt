/**
 * The controls, drawn from a layout document over whatever the user is playing.
 *
 * **Nothing here decides what the pad looks like any more.** The arrangement is a
 * [ControllerLayout] — a file — and this class turns it into windows. What that buys is not
 * tidiness: it is that the layout editor, the skin system and per-target profiles all become
 * possible, because there is finally something for them to edit, dress and select. While the pad
 * was a Kotlin file, none of them had a subject.
 *
 * Four rules shape the rest, and every one was learned from a device.
 *
 * **A control must not take focus.** The platform delivers a controller's events to the focused
 * window, so controls inside an ordinary activity send their input back to Kestrel — measured in
 * `docs/phase0/results/app-stick-focus-20260819-redmi-note-13-5g.json`.
 *
 * **A control must not cover anything it does not need.** The first version was one window the size
 * of the screen that consumed every touch on the phone; only a reboot recovered it. Each cluster of
 * controls gets a window sized to itself, and `Clustering` decides what a cluster is.
 *
 * **Touches must split across those windows.** `FLAG_SPLIT_TOUCH` is what lets a second finger reach
 * a second window. Without it, holding the stick froze every other control and the phone underneath.
 *
 * **A window is dead everywhere its controls are not**, and that cannot be fixed from here —
 * measured: a view refusing a touch does not hand it to the application below, and the platform's
 * own remedy is not public API. It is why clusters are kept as small as the layout allows.
