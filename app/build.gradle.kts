     * One key for every build this repository produces.
     *
     * Android treats a signature as an application's identity, so two builds signed by different
     * keys are two different applications and the second cannot install over the first. Gradle's
     * default debug config generates a keystore on the machine that builds, and a CI runner is a
     * fresh machine every time — so every build was signed by a different key, and every install
     * was a reinstall that took the user's permissions and settings with it.
     *
     * This key is committed and its password is public. That is fine for builds people are testing
     * deliberately and unacceptable for builds people are trusting, so a release must use a key
     * that is not in this repository. `signing/README.md` carries the full reasoning and the steps.

    // ordinary application. It is confined to platform/shizuku/ behind one capability boundary
    // (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md §558), and ADR-003 keeps it optional at runtime — with Shizuku absent

    // Reading and writing inside the folder the user chose.
    //
    // Why here: everything Kestrel keeps lives in a folder on shared storage that the user picks,
    // so it survives an uninstall and can be copied in a file manager. Reaching that folder means
    // the Storage Access Framework, whose framework API is DocumentsContract — a dozen calls of
    // URI arithmetic per operation, none of which can be exercised on a laptop. This library is the
    // thin wrapper AndroidX ships for exactly that, and it removes a class of fault this project
    // could only find on a device.
    //
    // Why not the alternative: MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE would need no library and would grant access
    // to every file on the phone, be a restricted permission, and — on the evidence of ADR-006 —
    // risk another Play Protect block for every user. A folder the user chose is both smaller and
    // more honest.
